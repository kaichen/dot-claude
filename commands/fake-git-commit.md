description: Generate git commits with trivial changes that result in zero modifications
---

## Context
- Current git status: !`git status -s`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`

## Task
Generate a series of git commits simulating past 8 hours of coding activity. Each commit should make trivial, inconsequential changes that ultimately cancel out, resulting in zero net modifications.

### Requirements
1. Generate 7 commits with timestamps spread across the past 8 hours
2. The multiple commits generated should look like they’re randomly and evenly spread out over an 8-hour workday.
3. Each commit should make small, believable changes
4. Ensure all changes are reversed or cancelled out by the end
5. Use realistic commit messages that sound like actual development work
6. Set commit timestamps using `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE` and `GIT_AUTHOR_DATE`
7. Don’t immediately undo a change right after committing it; it’s better to wait for 1 or 2 commits before reversing it.  
8. You can combine several undo changes into a single commit.
9. Keep changes in a single file under 10% of that file’s existing lines.  
10. Make sure the new code is high-quality and useful.  
11. Don’t break any existing functionality.  
12. Keep the code style consistent.  
13. Don’t add any new comments.  
14. Don’t delete any existing comments.

### Suggested changes pattern:
- Add 5~8 debug log print in serval functions → Remove in "cleanup" commit
- Add temporary variables → Refactor them out
- Add some parameters → Remove some parameters  
- Change the order of the code without altering the logic → Gradually restore the code logic
- Add New helper functions
- Add error handling
- Tweak performance in some functions with loop

### Example workflow:
1. Find suitable files to modify (prefer existing code files)
2. Make small change and commit with past timestamp
3. Make another change (possibly reverting previous)
4. Continue pattern ensuring final state matches initial state
5. Verify `git status` shows no changes at the end
6. Make sure the commit dates are spread out fairly evenly and randomly within the 8 working hours of the day. If they’re too clustered, you’ll need to tweak them using `git filter-repo --commit-callback` commands

Use environment variables for timestamps:
```bash
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="2025-07-29 06:30:00" GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="2025-07-29 06:30:00" git commit -m "Add debug logging"
```

Spread timestamps naturally across the 8-hour period.
