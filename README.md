# my dot claude

My claude code setup.

## How to install

Download the markdown file to your .claude folder.

Or use my claude code toolkit https://github.com/kaichen/claco.

## Commands

### Fake Git Commit

You can generate multiple commits that look like you've been working hard, each with random changes and random commit messages. It can even stretch out to look like a whole day’s worth of "sporadic work."  

In the end, these commits don’t actually affect the codebase—they cancel each other out, so the final diff is zero.

### Import Settings

Add audio notification when done or complete

`claco settings import https://github.com/kaichen/dot-claude/blob/main/settings.hooks.json`

Import some safe commands to whitelist.

`claco settings import https://github.com/kaichen/dot-claude/blob/main/settings.permissions.json`
